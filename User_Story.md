3. NICE TO HAVE

4. MAY OR MAY NOT HAVE
- As a user, I want to be able to discuss about a particular item posted to the platform
- As a user, I want to be able to add hash-tag to my posts
- As a user, I want to be able to view by hash-tags or themes
- As a user, I want to be able to have auto-filled or preset descriptions

- As a user, I want to be able to view individual item in a bundle, and I can see what bundles an item is in
- As a user, I want to be able to view the pages in different languages


## Define our key words
items

users

categories

hash-tags/styles


## Tough decisions about making a reservation
- Diners and owners need to remember the reservation details
- Length of stay (Duration)
- No shows or showing up with a different party size
- Table sizes and layouts
- Difficult or impossible to contact diners
- Walk-ins, phone bookings, etc.
- Overlapping bookings




## Planning
- Make assumptions
  - Only online bookings
  - Set a fixed duration
  - Only accept bookings on the hour
  - Party sizes always match reservation
  - Book seats, not tables!

- Simplify!
  - Anyone can make a restaurant

- Make mockups












## Modelling
- Pen and paper / Whiteboard
- Create models
- Draw relationships
- Authorization
